          In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right
          tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver
          fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and
          scalabilty are priorities on my radar.

        <p>
          I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm
          proficient in using modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I also
          have experience with state management libraries like Redux and MobX,
          as well as CSS preprocessors like SASS and LESS.
